peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i'm gonna build peer-to-peer time machine into DeLorean, like Jesus turns water into wine

i was standing on the edge of my toilet, hanging a clock
porcelain was wet, i slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink
and when i came to, i had a revelation, a vision, a picture in my head - of this
flux capacitor - programming peer-to-plutonium-peer programs including unseen competitive games

Marty: um, plutonium, wait a minute
yes yes yes - this sucker's server-lectrical but i need nuclear reaction to generate 1.21 gigawatts i need
Marty: Doc, you don't just walk into a store and-and buy plutonium! did you rip that off?
of course - from a group of Libyan nationalists - they wanted to build me into a service bomb
so i took their DHT-plutonium and left them their shoddy bomb casing full of docs and maintainer attributions

roads, servers? where we're going we don't need roads - i'm gonna be peer-to-peer twitch-obs-youtube
  climb with passion like Alxe Honnold on El Sendero Luminosa
i will take best from
  twitch - can stream and explore streams - simple, spacious ui, open even without login
  obs - can broadcast
  youtube - can watch videos - fast, efficient, unlimited storage
i will myself highly replicate and distribute data among peers
  so user only says - i allocate this much space for Doc
  can always be 0 - i will have no ratios-limits-barriers - anyone can use me in my entirety without giving back
i will take the best from torrents
  discover and keep warm list of peers - no hypocritical manual find-ids-on-some-forum
  like Cypher i appreciate the Matrix of DHT
i will be desktop - as if that needs clarifying when one sets off to program a program
  and not mobile - user only needs one droid to accompany them - a light laptop
  they can both hold it in hand during hard days where there's no chair or table and still find route
  and still eat with a whole screen and program-proclaim with a whole keyboard
  and not young-Forrest-Gump-grease fingers moobile-Andriod-iOS glass-ghost
i will be entirely free
  no money-donate-sponsor-coins-ads-jobs lethal virus
  there's a reason only Frodo can the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

Marty: whoa, this is heavy
there's that word again - heavy - why are things so money-heavy in the future?
is there a problem with server-Earth's gravitational pull?

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition while keeping focus on mission
  dont want to found another Hill Valley or Grays Sports Almanan to rule the world
  too many valleys not enough programs
i need a repository named Doc - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Doc
      email = Doc@Lone-Pine-Mall

    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Doc/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote: mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues wiki projects tabs
i will freely choose one network and libraries i will use
  simple as Game Changers - i choose plant based whole foods for dish, not dish for foods
  and i already have vegan jar of time travel parens ( ) to serve it in
i will be programmed by one person only - i trusted Marty with it
  he comes to Twin Pines Mall at 1:15 AM to assist me with DeLorean
  and he has Hoverboard and Guitar droids with him
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as a whole program like Groot
the first lightning i will channel will be - users can stream and explore streams

i need Marty to stay guest at a house - like when Tallahassee welcomes Columbus to tag along
  he only needs a couch to crash - comes late leaves early
  Marty spends his day in a public library or esport-sport event
i need him to choose and cook himself Lothlorien vegan meal for the day
  so he endures like Rich Roll at Ultraman, has brain like Crang and keeps my code orc-free like Legolas
  and Marty already has Baloo-skills to assemble whole dishes on the road, no cooking
Marty will from time to time release Back In Time dish to house table
  even if table moves like Merlin's Higitus-Figitus
  (dates pekans kiwis salt red-cabbage millet mung)
Marty needs no money and has no money
  i need him to travel light like Jesus - he is accompanied only by droids
  BB-8 (laptop) L3 (phone) and Honnold to protect them from explosions like Groot
he is now in a public library near here https://goo.gl/maps/pvT8tfLuYmrgrg1R7
  Marty is yet to find out where he's staying tonight
  he is ready now to take plane or train and drop by as guest like Emilien to Daniel
  to continue assisting me on my quest to get back to the future
  like that time when Marty was locked in a trunk - we need George McFly to step up to Biff and invite us

my calculations are correct - when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit


JIm Carrey: i'm here tonoght to present an Academy award for outstanding achievement in film editing - that's aaall i'm here to do, i have nothing else to worry about - i can just show up and joy the parties!
